  NGPT - Next Generation POSIX Threading

  TODO - last update 2002-05-01
  ====

  ITEMS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR 2.0
  ---------------------------------

  1.	Support for pshared flag = PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED attribute of mutexes.
	ACCEPTED IN 2.0.
	IMPLEMENTED IN 1.9.0.
  
  2.	POSIX Semaphore support.  There's a prototype but it needs a lot more work before
	it can be integrated in the main stream.
	ACCEPTED IN 2.0.
	IMPLEMENTED IN 1.9.0.

  3.	Configuration file may be needed. Currently all the configuration parameters of the library
	are passed via environment variables.  An ngpt.conf file in /etc needs to be created and
	be used to access configuration parameters of the library.
	UNDER EVALUATION IN 2.0.

  4.	Full debugging support.  There is none currently.  We need to build and test a version of
	gdb that will support this threading model.
	ACCEPTED IN 2.0.

  5.	Integration with glibc.  While not immediately pressing, the code base needs to be
	prepped for future integration with glibc.  This may involve some architectural changes
	but at present it doesn't seem as though this will be necessary.  Needs serious
	investigation.
	COMPLETE IN 1.2.2.  (NOTE: NGPT is not integrated into glibc builds but is compatible.)
	
  6.	POSIX Realtime support.  There's no support currently for the POSIX Realtime APIs. With
	the advent of kernel 2.4, these APIs may need to be supported before glibc integration
	can take place.
	PLANNED FOR POST 2.0.

  7.	Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the use of environment variables to trigger
	various behavior and overrides.  Additionally, there needs to be a few more enviroment
	variables exposed to enable further runtime control of the library.
	ACCEPTED IN 2.0.

  9.	"make test" not appropriate when building for a cross-compile environment.  This should be
	addressed.
	UPDATE: Anyone know a good way of fixing this?
