NGPT - Next Generation POSIX Threading

This introduces an M:N threading model to the Linux system.  This model will provide
better performance for multi-threaded applications that utilize the POSIX pthreads
library functionality.  This will be particularly true on SMP machines.

The goal of this project is to make threading on Linux more robust, more POSIX compliant
and more in line with the services provided by commerical Unix operating systems.
