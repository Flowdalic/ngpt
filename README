  NGPT - Next Generation POSIX Threading
  Version 2.2.1 (20-Mar-2003)

  ABSTRACT

  NGPT is the user-level portion of a POSIX pthreads library which provides
  non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
  execution (aka ``multithreading'') inside event-driven applications. All
  threads run in the same address space of the server application, but each
  thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal
  mask and errno variable.

  On SMP machines, this library will use an M:N threading model if enabled
  resulting in significantly improved performance.

  IMPORTANT NOTICE: 
  Release 1.1.0 is the first release of the "UNSTABLE" tree of the future NGPT 2.0.
  
  As an UNSTABLE RELEASE, this release is not suitable for use in a production 
  environment, however, it should be noted that we have done fairly extensive testing, 
  so problems are unlikely.  If you do encounter any problems with this release
  please post them to the NGPT website and the development team will address them.
