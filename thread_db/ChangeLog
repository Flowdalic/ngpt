      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

  Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3

   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
   *) td_utils.c:
   *) thread_dbP.h:
	Updates for PowerPC and S390 ucontext handling.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

  Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2

   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
	Removed unused variable to eliminate warning.
      [Bill Abt, <babt@us.ibm.com>]

   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
   *) td_utils.c:
	Additions for supported architectures and fixes for i386 
	and IPF.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
	Framework for addressing the supported platforms. Thus far
	only IA32 fully builds and is tested. More to come.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]
   *) td_ta_new.c:
	Code cleanup, from attach investigation.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) Makefile.in:
	Fixed the install/uninstall path.
      [Saurabh Desai, <sdesai@us.ibm.com>]

   *) td_ta_lwp_info.c:
	Fixed reference that was causing an invalid LWP number to be used
	that resulted in a crash of the debug session.
      td_ta_thr_iter.c:
	Fixed return status for bad thread tcb read to skip over thread 
	as a dead thread (ie. don't call iterator function for it). This
	stops failures when a thread tcb is unmapped on terminate and we
 	try to get it's status.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

  Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1

   *) Makefile.in:
	Cleaned up and fixed install-backup option.
      [Bill Abt, <babt@us.ibm.com>]

   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setfpregs.c:
	Fixed normalizing address bug for mctx fpregs in gdb address space
	that was causing a gdb core dump. Fixed setting of registers in a 
	thread mctx when it's waiting.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_utils.c:
   *) Makefile.in:
   *) thread_dbP.h:
   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
	Correct problems setting the registers with prgregset_t vs 
	gregset_t ordering differences.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_setgregs.c:
	Fix to correct get/set of ganeral and floating point registers
	for ucontext_t mctx. Also fixes ngpt pth_init case failure.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_thr_validate.c:
	Fix to correct detection of valid threads and reduce number of
	gdb ptraces to do the validation.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_ta_map_lwp2thr.c:
	Cleaned up compiler warnings.
      [Bill Abt, <babt@us.ibm.com>]

   *) td_ta_lwp_info.c:
   *) thread_dbP.h:
   *) Makefile.in:
	Added new module td_ta_lwp_info.c to do target lwp data access 
	and ngpt runtime native to gdb/libthread_db lwp mappings.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_symbol_list.c:
	Changes to add runtime native list access for td_ta_lwp_info.c
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_ta_map_id2thr.c:
	Reworked to clean up use of handles.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_ta_map_lwp2thr.c:

	native state for mapping a thread id to a lwp (native).
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_ta_new.c:
   *) td_ta_thr_iter.c:
   *) td_thr_validate.c:
	Added debug error reporting, generally done for all modules that
	were touched. If there are errors in libthread_db runtime recompile
	with '-DTD_DEBUG' and install the new library, and trace and error
	debug messages will be output to the screen. The volume is heavy,
	so it is only for debug but is helpful.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_thr_get_info.c:
	Reworked to use td_ta_lwp_info.c to access runtime lwp (native)
	structures, for identifying the lwp (native) that a thread runs
	on for the debugger.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) td_thr_getfpregs.c:
   *) td_thr_getgregs.c:

	mctx register state.
      [Dave Howell, <david.p.howell@intel.com>]

   *) thread_db.h:
